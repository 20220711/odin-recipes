    <h2>What is Bibimbap</h2>
    <p>Bibimbap is a classic Korean dish that translates to "mixed rice." It is typically served as a bowl of warm white rice topped with saut√©ed and seasoned vegetables, a variety of protein options (like beef, chicken, or tofu), and a sunny-side-up egg. A generous amount of gochujang (Korean chili paste) is often added for a spicy kick.</p>
    <p>The ingredients are stirred together just before eating, creating a delicious blend of textures and flavours. It is a popular and versatile dish that can be easily customised with your favourite ingredients, making it a satisfying and nutritious meal.</p>
