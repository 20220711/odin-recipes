    <h2>What is Braised Beef</h2>
    <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season beef generously with 3 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 teaspoons black pepper, and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Sear beef until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Remove beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in the same pot, then add chopped onion, halved mushrooms, carrots, and the cut head of garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in red wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up browned bits from the bottom. Let the wine reduce by half, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pot. Add thyme, bay leaves, Worcestershire, and beef broth. Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover and transfer the pot to a preheated 325°F (165°C) oven. Cook until beef is tender, about 2 ½ to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Check occasionally, adding more beef broth if needed to keep the beef partially submerged.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the pot from the oven. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Slice beef and arrange on a serving platter. Spoon vegetables and sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.</li>
    </ol>
